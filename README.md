1. You should download `NordicDeepSkyTheme.xml` and place it to your Blender's folder:

`.\scripts\presets\interface_theme\`

For example (for Windows):

`C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 4.3\4.3\scripts\presets\interface_theme\`

2. Then you should open Blender, go to Edit > Preferences -> Themes. And you'll see the theme NordicDeepSkyTheme in the list.
